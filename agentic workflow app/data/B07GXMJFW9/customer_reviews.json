    "body": "This blue Jeep is an excellent toy in every way. It will not scratch your floors when your child pretends to drive it. The colors are so vibrant and appealing to the eye; I like having it with all the toys for that reason alone. It\u2019s also a good size for a young or older child to play with. I have a 2 and 4 year old boy and girl and they both love playing with it. I really believe an older child would be interested in it as well. If you have little toy figurines, your child will have fun putting them inside the vehicle. Also sturdy and no fear of it breaking or falling apart. I love the company that makes these toys; just all around great quality. Your child\u2019s sense of imagination and desire for pretend play will ignite with this one."

    "body": "Gave this as a Christmas gift for my young granddaughter. She loves it ! It's larger than I expected but that's a plus. Not as big as a Tonka but a good size for a toddler, not too heavy. This is made by Battat and every toy I have ever purchased from that company is high quality at a reasonable price. My granddaughter likes to put her little people figures in there and they all go for a ride. It rolls easily and is sturdy enough to play with outside."

    "body": "These are the cutest little vehicles. They\u2019re very colorful and a good size for pushing around on the floor. My grandson had the trash truck for several months and it has been put through its paces and has endured. So we have purchased more for his house and my house. He absolutely loves them. If your child watches Trash Truck on Netflix, you definitely need to order the trash truck. So cute. The tissue box in picture is just for scale."

    "body": "Purchased this for a present and it was so cute as soon as it came my toddler wanted to rip it open and play with it, purchased for a one year old boy but my 18 month girl would have been just as happy to receive it. Looks like a fun toy and super durable we didn\u2019t take it out of the package but my friend son loves it. Also a really great size exactly what I was expecting."
