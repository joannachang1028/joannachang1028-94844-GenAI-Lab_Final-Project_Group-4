    "title": "Perfect for our recent Alaska trip (and future hiking and concert viewing)!",
    "body": "I tend to stress out about details and I did WAY too much research to still be so confused before I bought these. A friend had suggested this brand but I was torn between several different magnifications and outer lense sizes. Another friend finally joked - \"These are binoculars, not the Hubble telescope- make a decision already!\" So I did, and these were perfect!. Easy to use, very well made, large enough field of view to find things quickly and high enough magnification to really see detail while at the same time being low enough magnification to not have much trouble holding them still enough not to experience shaking. I just love these! Also, I initially had concerns about them being too bulky or heavy to want to cart around. These are full sized binoculars but not terribly heavy and the neck strap is comfortable. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to carry these on a long extended hike. I\u2019m extremely satisfied with my purchase. (Hint - you can attach the eyepiece cover to the neck strap. That way it will hang loose and out of your way but still be attached and you won\u2019t have to worry about losing it. )"

    "body": "Bought them on the Spring Sale, needing to up-grade my binoc's. With the BaK-4 glass, and it's waterproofing, these were meant for me. Extreme outdoorsman, in grizzly and moose country. These are better than my Nikon's. Crystal clear viewing, perfect magnification, (10x42). Diopter works perfect. Comes with a carrying case, neck strap, and micro-fiber cloth. Unlike the pics online, it's a dark blue. Luv it. Not compact, and not full-size, a mid-ground between the sizes."

    "title": "Great beginner pair but heavy for those with joint issues",
    "body": "I haven't had these for very long so I can't speak to the longevity of them but I got them because they're fog and waterproof and were within budget. I also liked the lifetime warranty that's offered so I feel better about traveling with them or letting others borrow them when I inevitably upgrade later on.\nSo far I haven't noticed any chromatic abberation (when the colors distort around the field of vision and or around the objects in the frame) and it focuses well. It seems to not focus closer by and focuses better farther away.\nOverall, I'm fairly impressed. I got into birding and nature observing recently and needed a good beginner binocular. I was told by my local birding group that this is a good brand so I read up on them and liked their policies and the prices were really good for what they offered especially when compared to celestron and Nikon binos that I tried that are in the $150 range.\nThe neck strap it came with is basic but better than a couple other stock ones I've seen from other brands. I'm definitely going to get a more comfortable one or a harness to use with these because they are pretty heavy. I have joint pain and mobility issues and even after 5 minutes my wrists were getting pretty angry. It's not enough for me to want to send them back but they're definitely going to be used for quick looks. The weight does feel good in that I don't feel like they are cheap or will break easily if left in my car or accidentally dropped. I took off the one star for the weight which is more on me than the company, they do have the weight listed in the description and some reviews said they were heavy and some said they were not. I knew I was taking a chance with that. But like I said it took a good 5 minutes before my wrists were hurting and in the field I can easily just not hold them that long.\nThe bag they come in is pretty flimsy. It's not as thin as the one my big celestron binos came in but it definitely won't take a beating. If you want to travel around with these in an airport or somewhere they might get banged around in i suggest investing in a more padded bag made of canvas, duck, denim, or twill. I've seen some good ones here on Amazon. If you want to make your own i suggest the above fabrics, a layer of quilt batting, and a layer of insulation batting such as insul-bright to protect it from temperatures. (At least that's what i would do, I'm sure there are tutorials online with other ideas).\nLike others said, the end caps aren't connected at all and fall off easily. I wish they were connected because they will easily become lost.\nOver all, I think these are great beginner binos for casual birding/observing. Definitely a pair i would travel with."

    "title": "Great choice!",
    "body": "I spent a long time selecting binoculars based on their technical characteristics. This unit had everything I wanted and was very reasonably priced. I was a little worried about having only 2 reviews, but I took a chance. And I did not regret my choice! Without going into technical details, these binoculars met all my expectations! It shows clear views both during the day and at night. There are only three little drawbacks. First, I wish the included bag was made of a thicker, more practical material, like canvas. Secondly, it is a little heavy. For adult hands this is not a problem, but my daughter is a teenager and she claimed ownership of the device, but after 15 minutes of use her hands get a little tired, for her a 7x35 would be a better choice. Third, the large caps do not fit tight enough to stay in place, they fall off before I can get the binoculars in it's case. But despite this, using this device, you will be physically and visually satisfied with its quality and capabilities."

    "title": "Nice balance between magnification and portability",
    "body": "Love these for the price! I struggled a little to decide if I wanted to focus on optical quality or portability. I think these are a nice compromise. I love the way the eye pieces pop out and helps me fit my eye better than I have experienced with other binoculars. The caps are so nice to protect the lenses, but the bottom covers can fall off even with the secondary tether. It would be nice if those could be more firmly attached. The neck strap is soft, but I would like a little more adjustability - the shortest hang I can get still has it at an awkward spot with a lot of swing when hiking. They have been great for birding and whale watching, though! Very pleased overall!"

    "body": "These binoculars turned my Alaska trip into a front-row wildlife documentary. I spotted eagles like they were auditioning for a close-up, watched whales without squinting, and even saw a bear from a safe distance (emphasis on safe).\n\nThey\u2019re lightweight enough to hang around my neck without feeling like I\u2019m training for the Olympics, and durable enough to survive being jostled around on a bumpy boat ride. The views? Crystal clear. Honestly, I think I could see Russia if Sarah Palin lent me her deck.\n\nIf you\u2019re traveling to Alaska (or anywhere wild), these binoculars are a must\u2014because some sights are just too epic to leave blurry."
