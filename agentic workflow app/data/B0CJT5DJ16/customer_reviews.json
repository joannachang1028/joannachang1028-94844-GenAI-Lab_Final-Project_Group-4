    "title": "Long review, but it's amazing",
    "body": "I 100% bought this because I'm an Elden Ring fan (PS5). I didn't want to be tied down to the loft all the time either. For reference, my Internet has 4 waypoints throughout the house (2 upstairs and 2 down), and a router on the outside of the house (Breaker box - Yeah, my first experience with that, too).\n\nHere's my legitimate experience: This thing is awesome. Gameplay is absolutely seamless. It acts as a controller if you're sitting right in front of the TV. I tested it with PvP (Person vs Person) online play, and also seamless.\n\nThe only complaint I have is when I'm in my bedroom and the door is closed, every now and then I'll get an \"Internet is Weak\" symbol. But if you play online, it's very mild and semi resembles lag for a second. Then it's back to being good. Other than that, all rooms (Including the garage) work well. As an online player, I have to steas that's a minor inconvenience, I have not been kicked from an online game.\n\nI have not tried playing remotely from another WiFi source, so I can't give a review on that portion. BUT, this has 100% met my needs.\n\nScreen quality is the same as my TV (Sony, 2023 Smart TV), linking it to my PS5 was surprisingly easy, and all games were available.\n\n100% wish I had known about this before. If you're an avid player, definitely a freedom piece to roam your house/apartment."

    "title": "Fantastic Device",
    "body": "Although my absolute wish from Sony would be for a dedicated handheld, this will do for now.\n\nForm factor and ergonomics - Very comfy to hold and not heavy. Essential a Dualsense controller shopped in half with a screen attached in between. So regular Dualsense users will feel right at home. The only thing that takes getting use to is the PS button and the touch screen for obvious reason. I really like how the power, volume buttons are designed to be away from the top of the screen bezel compared to other handhelds. This prevents accidental button pressing and is easy to reach. And for once, the controller (I'll call it lightbar) is visible while gaming, so seeing games interact with this light is amazing.\n\nPlaying the Portal (wired internet connection to PS5) - Although the latency is there, most games are very playable. Playing first person shooters are difficult, especially games that require fast reaction times, but playable. Playing games away from my home also works great. It was highly hesitant about playing games with slow latency, but being able to catch up on games while in bed or when the TV is being used is a huge win for me. Current game I am playing is Silent Hill 2 and it runs great on the Portal.\n\nMinor downsides - Battery life, I think can be better. I'm getting roughly 3 to 4 hours of game play with full Dualsense features, speakers, and screen brightness high (not full brightness). I think it's a given that if I disable most of the Dualsense features the battery would last longer, although all the features are so nice to have on a portable device. The speakers could also be better, although fairly loud, the clarity and low tones such as bass are missing. At least comparing to Steam Deck, the speakers are much better here, where you can actually here more details in games. With the Portal, I found that it was lacking that clarity, Silent Hill 2 for example, it is hard to hear the ambient background noise, and surrounding enemy direction. The other sounds are amplified such as character grunts and voices.\n\nOverall I'm really enjoying this streaming device, and only hope Sony will come out with a dedicated handheld with the same form factor. I will definitely continue using the Portal for a long time coming."

    "title": "Fantastic device for what it is: a PS5 remote player with all the functionality of a PS5 controller",
    "body": "The PS portal is a remote play device that connects to your PS5 allowing you to play games without use of the television. This is what it is advertised as doing, and it does this very well. There has been a recent update to the device that allows you to stream games from the PS Plus library of games if you are a PS Plus subscriber, completely bypassing your PS5. As of this review, the feature is still in beta, however, from my testing it works well. If you have a good connection from your PS5 to your router and have a good WiFi connection outside, you can even remote play your PS5 while you are not at home, such as in a hotel. I suggest using your phone's hot spot on a 5G connection to do this.\n\nFor a more responsive and lag free experience make sure your PS5 is connected to your router with an Ethernet cable instead of connecting via WiFi. This will provide a stable experience on your PS Portal.\n\nRemember that this is not a stand alone console like a Switch or a Steam Deck allowing you to play games directly on the machine. The PS Portal connects to your PS5 or can stream games from the PS Plus library if you are a subscriber.\n\nThe PS Portal itself has all the functions of the PS5 controller which is awesome. That means when you play a game that makes use of the adaptive triggers, the PS Portal will feel just like your PS5 controllers. For instance, pulling an arrow back on a bow in a game with the actually feels like there is bow string tension in the trigger. This is light years better than just getting a set of controllers that attaches to a phone for remote play. It also has all the buttons like the PS button, screen capture button, and options button. The only thing missing is the touch pad. In order to use the touch pad, you actually touch the screen on the PS Portal and a virtual touch pad pops up on the screen.\n\nMy favorite feature is that the PS Portal allows you to wake up your PS5 from sleep mode. If someone in the house is using the TV, no problem. Just pick up your PS Portal, connect to your PS5, and starting playing your games!"

    "title": "PlayStation Portal Remote Player - PlayStation 5",
    "body": "The PlayStation Portal Remote Player is an intriguing addition to the PlayStation 5 ecosystem, designed to enhance the gaming experience by offering remote play capabilities. Here\u2019s a detailed review of this innovative device:\n\n### Design and Build\nThe PlayStation Portal features a sleek and modern design that mirrors the aesthetics of the PlayStation 5. It\u2019s lightweight and ergonomically designed, making it comfortable to hold during extended gaming sessions. The build quality feels premium, with a sturdy construction that promises durability.\n\n### Display and Performance\nThe device boasts a vibrant 8-inch LCD screen with a resolution of 1080p, ensuring crisp and clear visuals. While it\u2019s not OLED, the display still provides good color reproduction and brightness levels, making games look sharp and engaging. The performance is smooth, with minimal latency during gameplay, provided you have a stable and fast internet connection.\n\n### Connectivity\nThe PlayStation Portal relies on Wi-Fi for remote play, streaming games directly from your PS5. The setup process is straightforward, and once connected, it offers a seamless gaming experience. However, the quality of gameplay heavily depends on the strength and stability of your Wi-Fi network. In areas with poor connectivity, you might experience lag or lower video quality.\n\n### Controls\nThe device incorporates the same haptic feedback and adaptive triggers found in the DualSense controller, providing a tactile and immersive gaming experience. The controls are responsive and intuitive, ensuring that the transition from a standard controller to the remote player is smooth and natural.\n\n### Battery Life\nThe battery life of the PlayStation Portal is decent, offering around 4-5 hours of continuous play on a single charge. While this might not be enough for marathon gaming sessions, it\u2019s sufficient for casual or on-the-go gaming. The device charges via USB-C, which is convenient and ensures relatively quick recharging times.\n\n### Use Cases\nThe PlayStation Portal is perfect for situations where you want to play your PS5 games away from your main console setup, such as in another room or even on the go. It\u2019s also useful for households with shared TV usage, allowing you to continue your gaming sessions without hogging the main screen.\n\n### Price and Value\nPriced at a premium, the PlayStation Portal is a niche device catering to dedicated PlayStation enthusiasts. While it adds convenience and flexibility to the gaming experience, the cost might be a deterrent for some, especially when compared to simply using existing devices like smartphones or tablets with a DualSense controller for remote play.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe PlayStation Portal Remote Player for the PlayStation 5 is a well-designed and functional device that enhances the versatility of the PS5 gaming experience. With its comfortable design, responsive controls, and decent display quality, it offers a solid remote play solution. However, its reliance on a strong Wi-Fi connection and relatively high price point might limit its appeal to only the most dedicated PlayStation fans. If you frequently find yourself wanting to play your PS5 games away from your main setup, the PlayStation Portal is a worthy investment."

    "title": "Awesome",
    "body": "Update: still awesome but now on a trip 2313 miles away from home. Worked great 5 of the 6 days I was here, but now one the last day (and two hours later, yes I\u2019m obsessed with getting this bi**h to connect) it\u2019s failed to connect. Assuming it\u2019s the travel router..but dropping a star because I shouldn\u2019t need one. Sony needs to add a browser to this thing so we can click the silly message on captive wifi and just get on the network. I didn\u2019t buy this to utilize while at a vacation home with my family that has standard wifi. I bought it for travel, work travel, in which I live in hotels and airports..which, guess what, Sony, use mf\u2019in CAPTIVE WIFI BRO! Just let the browser work for that one simple thing. Got darn vultures.\n\nI\u2019m not going to write some wannabe tech dude review here, you all know what it does at this point if you don\u2019t have one yet. What I can tell you is this for those on the fence, it is not able to utilize captive wifi (wifi that first makes you open your browser and enter credentials or watch a short video or whatever), so if you plan on using it at hotels or airports, etc., you\u2019ll also have to buy a travel router to bypass that. On vacation hundreds of miles away on standard wifi it works perfectly so long as your home connection is strong and the wifi at the location you are at is decent. I really do love it as I used to pack my whole ass PlayStation for business trips for downtime, now I can fit it in my backpack! Pro tip for those of you that may play late at night and keep your PlayStation in a room your family may still be using while you\u2019re gone. Keep PlayStation in rest mode (you have to anyways) but unplug the HDMI from the back of the TV so it won\u2019t turn your tv/monitor on when you connect the Portal. Also, go into settings on your PS5 and turn off the dang startup beep so you don\u2019t startle everyone in the house in the middle of the night because you had to get your gamer fix on. Lastly, turn down the console lights to low so your PS5 doesn\u2019t light up a room no one is in and causes folks to come investigating something that isn\u2019t actually a concern. Other than that, it\u2019s awesome, nice big screen and the controller feels like the standard controller, just have to get used to your hands being significantly further apart. Really though, if you can\u2019t decide and you love to game and have to travel, worth every penny and more."

    "title": "Love it!",
    "body": "I absolutely love my PS Portal. The setup was super easy, and it connects to my PS5 flawlessly. The controls feel identical to a DualSense \u2014 same triggers, same haptic feedback \u2014 so it\u2019s like using a full controller with a high-quality screen in the middle. The display is sharp, the colors are vibrant, and the gameplay feels incredibly smooth as long as you have a strong Wi-Fi connection. I am using StarLink and no issue at all\n\nI use it all the time when someone\u2019s watching TV or when I just want to chill on the couch or bed and keep playing my games. Battery life has been solid, and the device feels premium and comfortable to hold for long sessions."

    "title": "Finally a standalone handheld console with Cloud Streaming!",
    "body": "Edit 11/9/2025: Upping this to 5 stars. PlayStation released cloud streaming recently and it is AMAZING. All the connectivity issues with Remote Play back to my PS5 are nonexistent with Cloud Streaming, and there are nearly 3,000 games available. The Portal finally feels like a standalone handheld console, rather than being tethered to a (sometimes) finicky Remote Play connection\n\nI really wanted to use this device more. I loved the idea of having the ability to play my PlayStation 5 from the couch with something else on TV. However, there are some limitations:\n\n1) Your PS5 must be plugged in via ethernet for this to work well. For whatever reason, the WiFi on this device isn't as strong as something like an iPhone when my PlayStation 5 was connected via WiFi.\n\n2) Not a great device for traveling. Due to the device size, it's hard (especially adding a case) to fit this in a smaller bag or easily pull out on a plane. Obviously, this is limited too by the fact that it needs to connect back to your PS5, and I had pretty consistent issues trying to use hotel WiFi or hotspots to connect.\n\nIf you don't mind the above flaws, this device feels great, the feedback is great, and as a controller it's the closest thing to a DualSense controller. My only gripe with the controller itself is the sticks are smaller than they are on normal controller, and I would've liked the bigger size."

    "title": "Somewhat disappointing",
    "body": "While it's a good idea on paper, the execution could be better.\n\nPositives. If your network connection is good, it streams games well. The image on the screen looks nice, the sound is decent, the device looks great overall, and it's a great accessory for your PS5. Also, the price is good, it would have been a great value if not for...\n\nNegatives. The very first thing that I saw when I turned the device on for the first time is a stuck pixel on the screen (meaning one pixel is always on, and it's bright white, which can be very distracting). At least it's in a corner, but I've seen people reporting them right in the middle of the screen. In a normal market, it would be an easy exchange for a new unit, things happen, but, this is not a normal market. These toys are extremely hard to get, and on top of almost a month-long wait with a 2 weeks delay, which meant a Christmas present for a child arriving almost 2 weeks after Christmas, it now seems like we're stuck with a defective unit. They're still nearly impossible to order from anywhere. I can't exchange this unit, only return, and then of course won't be able to order another, and even if I did (the first one took weeks of trying and monitoring restocks to finally secure an order), they're showing delivery dates in March at this point. I know it's not Amazon's fault, and this review is not about Amazon, just to be clear. It's Sony, their product and how they roll it out. Speaking of Sony, there is warranty, but from what I understand, we will have to ship the unit to Sony (makes sense), but there is no info on when a replacement can be shipped back (not good), and on top of that, it will most likely be a refurbished unit. This is a bad situation. The product is defective, and we can return it, but not get a replacement, or get it replaced under warranty with a refurb, weeks or maybe even months later.\n\nIt's also not very comfortable to hold. While looking the same, for some reason the actual controllers are angled differently from the regular PS5 controller. It's hard to explain, but it creates a very unusual angle for your hands when you hold it, especially since the device is so wide, my hands get tired very quickly. May not be an issue for a kid, but I call it a negative for sure.\n\nAs I said, it streams great if your connection is good, and mine is good, but I still experience issues. In most cases it's smooth and responsive, but sometimes, seemingly out of nowhere, it starts lagging like crazy and gets virtually unusable. On top of that, it fails to connect to PS5 on the first try almost every time. I have to keep trying to connect several times until it finally does.\n\nThere are some small annoyances too, like the \"Remote Play active\" message that remains at the top of your Portal's screen while you're using it. There is also no Bluetooth support, so you have to either use Sony's own headphones or buds, or a wired headset.\n\nWith that said, I'm having mixed feelings about this one. We definitely see a benefit of having a device like this around, but the quality issues followed by support issues are very concerning. The price is good, but clearly cheaped out on the screen panel, as I see many others online reporting dead or stuck pixels, and I haven't seen a stuck pixel in years, until now. We also see some minor backlight bleed. Not too bad, but there are portable gaming systems with amazing OLED screens, and this screen is below average for sure.\n\nConclusion. A good idea, but execution could be better. If you're considering one, I'd recommend waiting a couple of months if you can. Once they're readily available in stores, if anything is wrong with your unit, you will be able to replace it without having to jump through hoops or wait for months."

    "title": "Solid handheld with restrictions",
    "body": "Overall the PS Portal is a great device. I\u2019ll list my personal pros and cons but the takeaway I want to leave it is that if you have solid and dependable WiFi, then the device should be considered. If not, even for travel, then it\u2019s not going to be worth it in my opinion. I did try and use this for travel such as airplanes and it was ok for some points but not very dependable. Also, since this device now offers cloud gaming I\u2019ll split my views on both as well.\n\nPros:\n- Perfect size and lightweight. If you\u2019ve held a PS5 controller then this feels practically the same as far as grip and comfortability.\n-The screen is up to 1080p and up to 60 fps so pretty clear and smooth as long as you have consistent and strong WiFi.\n- The power and volume buttons are on the top and easy to access and pretty tactile so you\u2019ll know when they\u2019re pressed down.\n- Thumbsticks and overall buttons on the controller feel the same as the PS5 controller. Thumb sticks are smaller and more sensitive, so they\u2019ll move around a bit more freely compared to the actual controller.\n- The system does have haptic feedback, so games that use this feature like Guardians of the Galaxy will use this to the full capability. Feels like you\u2019re much more immersed into the game.\n- Battery life was good. I was able to get over 4 hours for remote play and for the cloud.\n- Easy to pick up and play. For remote play, the system picks off whenever you last were, based just off of rest mode on the PS5. You\u2019ll turn on the power button, and depending on how far you are from your PS5 and your overall WiFi it\u2019ll take up to a minute or two in my experience to connect to your PS5. I was able to connect to my PS5 from across the country pretty easily.\nFor cloud, this would be even easier since no PS5 is required. Depending again on your WiFi, this will take up to a minute.\n- Device price. For $200, having an official ps controller in your hands with a 1080p screen and able to seamlessly play PS5 games is a pretty solid deal for remote play. You can use ps5 remote play with your phone or even other handhelds, but having actual controller trigger and haptic feedback is what makes this system great to me. Now if you\u2019re purchasing this for cloud, I put my opinion as a con.\n\nCons:\n- WiFi, WiFi, WiFi. If you want to use the system, you have to have solid WiFi that won\u2019t drop in speed or connection. If at any time the connection drops, for remote or for cloud, the game quality significantly drops to pixels, followed by getting disconnected from your PS5 or cloud. You\u2019ll have to go through the process of reconnecting. If your WiFi isn\u2019t strong, this is a repeating cycle and takes away from gaming.\n- Not for geared for multiplayer games. Cloud does have a few multiplayer games at the moment like dead by daylight, and works pretty good. But multiplayer games for remote play isn\u2019t quite worth it if that\u2019s your reasoning of purchasing the system. Even when sitting right next to the system, there\u2019s a small but noticeable input lag for games. Single player games can get away with this most of the time, but multiplayer games will end up hindering the experience. I tried playing Marvel Rivals through remote play and although the game looked great and was overall smooth, the connection felt much demanding and any movement was a bit delayed. You can definitely continue to play if your WiFi is strong, but I\u2019d stay away from more competitive multiplayer games.\n- No Bluetooth on the device. This one is pretty shocking considering it is a modern system, but Sony decided the only native Bluetooth headphones you can use are the ones they made specifically for the system. These are a separate purchase, and are the only official way to use Bluetooth headphones. There\u2019s a button on top of the device that\u2019s for connecting to these Sony buds. If you don\u2019t have them, the button does absolutely nothing when pressed. You may be able to get around using Bluetooth headphones if you really want by putting in a Bluetooth adapter into the headphone jack. Otherwise you\u2019ll have to just use the system speakers which aren\u2019t bad, or use the headphone jack which is in the bottom of the screen itself.\n- Gestures and touchscreen. Gestures don\u2019t really work. I connected remotely to my PS5 and played Detroit become Human on this device, and overall the experience was good but when fast action sequences start, the game thinks you\u2019re playing on a PS5 (technically a PS4 for this specific game) and wants you to turn your \u201ccontroller\u201d certain ways to dodge or move in-game. The PS Portal does support this but it\u2019s often not smooth as swinging an actual controller. You\u2019ll likely miss events like that from games. Touchscreen is also not designed very well. Games that expect trackpad inputs, you\u2019ll have to touch the screen and deal with your fingerprints smudged on there. Not great, but I guess to keep this price point adding a back touchpad like the PS Vita wasn\u2019t an option.\n- Cloud pricing. Cloud is great overall, the list of games seems to grow every week at the moment. The games launch quick and are pretty smooth. To note the list of games available is completely different than the cloud games on the PS5. The cloud games on the PS Portal are unique to this system and currently not as many as the PS5. The reason why this is a con for me is its pricing. You\u2019re not only paying for the console, but you\u2019re paying a monthly or yearly subscription to play these games. Sure you don\u2019t have to worry about storage, but paying continuously for a system that quite literally depends on WiFi is a bold move. This wouldn\u2019t be terrible if you really want to take this on the go and are ok with paying extra every year, but when have subscription prices ever dropped for anything? Ps Plus prices will likely and inevitably rise, and that\u2019s something to consider always when purchasing PS Plus.\n- Travel. I actually bought this as the main intention for travel. Despite more technical reviews I thought I\u2019d give it a shot and took this across the globe with me to a few countries. At airports, this device barely worked. Because you need strong and reliable WiFi, I could only play on this system in lounges and even that was finicky at times. Airplanes? Forget it. Hotels it worked ok, but I disconnected pretty often for remote play, but was ok for cloud gaming, I was mainly getting 720p instead of 1080p. I think the only ok way of travel play would be your mobile hotspot, but this varies completely depending on your plan and connection. Staying over at families and friends and using their WiFi worked pretty good. Remote play in this scenario took about 5 min to connect but the input lag was horrendous, making it unplayable. Cloud worked perfect though.\n\nOverall if you want play PS5 games, with the same controller feeling and feedback, while at work in your office or in another room, patio, or family/ mfriends house with dependable and strong WiFi, this system is solid. If cloud is what\u2019s drawing you that\u2019s great, but consider the overall cost again and be comfortable with a sticky, fixed and likely growing subscription. Consider where you\u2019ll be using this system and the WiFi in that area."
