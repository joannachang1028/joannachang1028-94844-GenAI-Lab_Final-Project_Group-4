My skin feels really clean after washing, but never tight or dry just soft and refreshed. It removes makeup, sunscreen, and oil easily without stripping my skin barrier.\nWhat I love most is the gentle formula. It has ceramides and niacinamide, which help keep my skin balanced and hydrated. I also have sensitive/combination skin, and this cleanser doesn\u2019t cause any irritation or breakouts. The pump bottle is convenient and lasts a long time, so it\u2019s great value for the price.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a dermatologist-recommended cleanser that truly delivers, I highly recommend giving this one a try. It\u2019s become a staple in my skincare routine!"

Even my dermatologist has recommended it!\n\nIf you're looking for a reliable, no-nonsense cleanser that does exactly what it promises, you can\u2019t go wrong with this one. Affordable, effective, and genuinely skin-friendly \u2014 it\u2019s now a staple in my routine!"

This is by far the most effective moisturizing makes my skin soft is the best quality and was recommended by my dermatologist and I have to agree. I will say this is good for all types of skin And is extremely effective. I only have to do one face wash for my face to feel clean. It also does remove my make up. I love it so much. I keep one in the shower and one at the sink. Product is colorless."

    "title": "Cleans well, but lingers...",
    "body": "I keep searching for a gentle foaming cleanser that will work well with my oily skin. I really wanted to like this cleanser, but it feels like it's hard to get off my skin. Even if it looks washed off, it still feels like it leaves a residue and that drives me nuts. I went from washing my face in the sink with it to only using it in the shower, so I can make sure I get it completely off. It does the job and has a mild scent that doesn't bother me, and it does feel gentle on my skin. It also lasts a long while for the size of the bottle. But due to the residue issue, I won't be buying it again."

Leaves skin feeling so nice and clean in my opinion. Suds nicely, washes off easily. I've used this for a couple years now and am still just as happy with it as I was at first. This bottle is a good, big size and a good value for the money."

    "title": "The best",
    "body": "Love that the CeraVe\u202fFoaming\u202fFacial\u202fCleanser is formulated with skin-friendly ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide to support the skin\u2019s barrier and retain moisture while cleansing; to me this means more bang for your buck in a face wash.\n\nHowever, because it\u2019s a foaming gel aimed at normal to oily skin, if you have drier skin it can feel slightly drying if not followed by adequate hydration. I personally have combination skin but my main concern right now is large pores and acne in some areas so I am using this to control oil production and calm redness. This is light but still lathers, I find it able to remove makeup. However I do alternate days where I double cleanse with something more abrasive to ensure I\u2019m really getting all the grime and dead skin cells sluffed off."
